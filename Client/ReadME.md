# How to cross compile Qt5 for Rasbperry Pi 3 with remote debugging

## Introduction 
This is a gudie to cross compile Qt5 code for Raspberry pi 3 using Linux PC. 
Once you have finished you will be able to write code with Qt as nomally would.
When you want to build ready to buildt it for the Raspberry Pi, then just select the build option for Raspberry and then compile for the Pi. The guide follows [Heavy Bare Metal](http://heavybaremetal.com/index.php/blog/6-how-to-cross-compile-qt-5-for-raspberry-pi-3)'s guide. 

## Install Reaspberry Pi OS (Buster)
First you have to install the [Raspberry image (Buster)](https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/operating-systems/) with desktop. The image is the legacy image. After that you have get it on WIFI and then enable ssh in Raspberry Pi Configuration. Then run the command 
```bash
ifconfig
```
And then find the ip for the wlan0. It's under the inet. For me it is 
```bash
172.16.0.7
```
Then connect thourgh SSH
```bash
ssh <username>@<pi ip adress>
```
```bash
ssh pi@172.16.0.7
```
**If it won't work** then use the ssh-kygen command
```bash
ssh-keygen
```
You are going to connect to the pi thourgh SSH a few time. So you may wish to enable key based login without a password. So if you run the command.
```bash
ssh-copy-id <username>@<pi ip adress>
```
**If** you are not out of the pi when you run the command. So run **exit** and then run the command above. Now you have ssh access to the Raspberry Pi.

### In Raspberry
The first thing you wanna on is run the command below, and the remove the '#' on the third line as you can see in the teminal output to step below. It will enable the deb-src. 

```bash
sudo nano /etc/apt/sources.list
```

```bash
eb http://raspbian.raspberrypi.org/raspbian/ buster main contrib non-free rpi
# Uncomment line below then 'apt-get update' to enable 'apt-get source'
deb-src http://raspbian.raspberrypi.org/raspbian/ buster main contrib non-free $
```

Now you have to update the Pi with the command
```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt full-upgrade -y && sudo apt autoremove -y
```
If there was installed any package you will have to reboot 
```bash
sudo reboot
```
Now the normal setup for the Raspberry Pi is done. 

## Install all software and tools needed in Linux 
Now we will install the varios Qt and graphics libraries for building Qt code for the Pi. If you just un the following commands it will be done. 
```bash
sudo apt build-dep qt4-x11 -y
```
```bash
sudo apt build-dep libqt5gui5 -y
```
```bash
sudo apt install -y libudev-dev libinput-dev libts-dev libxcb-xinerama0-dev libxcb-xinerama0
```
```bash
sudo mkdir /usr/local/qt5pi
```
```bash
sudo chown pi:pi /usr/local/qt5pi
```
```bash
sudo rpi-update
```
```bash
sudo reboot
```

## Create a sysroot folder in the Linux, that will synchronize the Pi and the Linux
Now we need to synchrnize the Linux with the Pi. We will be creating the directiory "raspy" in the home directory to hold the development tools and the sysroot that will be created, to mirror files form the Pi. Firstly we want to get the Raspberry Pi tools, to create out sysroot. 
### In the Linux
```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt full-upgrade -y && sudo apt autoremove -y
```
```bash
mkdir ~/raspi && cd ~/raspi
```
```bash
sudo apt install git python python3 -y
```
```bash
git clone https://github.com/raspberrypi/tools
```
```bash
mkdir sysroot sysroot/usr sysroot/opt
```
Now we can generalise the ip adress for the Raspberry using the command below, but if you havn't create a ssh-key for the Raspberry run the command and press enter 3 times and password for the Pi. 
```bash
ssh-keygen
```
```bash
export PI_IP=<pi IP adress>
```
Then run the command and press enter. 
```bash
ssh-copy-id pi@$PI_IP
```

Now we want to synchronize the Raspberry folders to the Linux PC with the following commands. You can skip the PI_IP and just use the Raspberry Pi  IP adress. 

```bash
rsync -avz pi@$PI_IP:/lib sysroot
```
```bash
rsync -avz pi@$PI_IP:/usr/include sysroot/usr
```
```bash
rsync -avz pi@$PI_IP:/usr/lib sysroot/usr
```
```bash
rsync -avz pi@$PI_IP:/opt/vc sysroot/opt
```
Note: There may be one or two errors, due to symbolic links and such, this wonâ€™t matter.

There is a mistake in one of the scripts, so we have to fix that one before we continues. The mistake is just instaed of make = it is make == a few places. Kukkimonsuta has fixed the script, so we just get it from his github. 
```bash
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Kukkimonsuta/rpi-buildqt/master/scripts/utils/sysroot-relativelinks.py

```
```bash
chmod +x sysroot-relativelinks.py

```
```bash
./sysroot-relativelinks.py sysroot
```
## Build Qt from source, and any Qt modules we migth need 
Now we need to install the Qt. We will be using the 5.12.3 version, because that one works. But before we install Qt we have to install some libraries and utilies for later use. 
### On the Linux
```bash
sudo apt install -y libgl1-mesa-dev libglu1-mesa-dev mesa-common-dev libxkbcommon-x11-0
```
```bash
sudo apt-get install -y lib32z1
```
```bash
sudo apt-get install -y libxcb-xinerama0-dev
```
```bash
sudo apt-get install -y flex bison gperf libicu-dev libxslt-dev ruby
```
```bash
sudo apt-get install -y libssl-dev libxcursor-dev libxcomposite-dev libxdamage-dev libxrandr-dev libfontconfig1-dev libcap-dev libxtst-dev libpulse-dev libudev-dev libpci-dev libnss3-dev libasound2-dev libxss-dev libegl1-mesa-dev gperf bison
```
Now we got the libraries and the utilities we can install the Qt
```bash
cd ~/Downloads
```
```bash
wget http://download.qt.io/official_releases/qt/5.12/5.12.3/qt-opensource-linux-x64-5.12.3.run
```
```bash
chmod +x qt-opensource-linux-x64-5.12.3.run
```
```bash
./qt-opensource-linux-x64-5.12.3.run
```
Note: That in Qt you need to have a account. You also need to check all of these thing off and you add more modules if you want to.
![alt text](Pictures/Qt_installer.png "QT Installer")

After the installation we have have to download the source code for Qt to build for the Pi.
### On the Linux
```bash
cd ~/raspi
```
```bash
it clone git://code.qt.io/qt/qtbase.git -b 5.12.3
```
After this we have to fix a broken mkspec for the Pi. The easiest way is just to replace the file. 
```bash
git clone https://github.com/LangtonsAnt/Qt5.12.3-RPi3-mkspec.git
```
```bash
cp Qt5.12.3-RPi3-mkspec/qmake.conf qtbase/mkspecs/devices/linux-rasp-pi3-g++/
```
```bash
cd qtbase
```
The next command will configure Qt ready for building. It will take around 5 - 10 minutes. 
```bash

```
```bash
./configure -release -egl -opengl es2 -device linux-rasp-pi3-g++ -device-option CROSS_COMPILE=~/raspi/tools/arm-bcm2708/gcc-linaro-arm-linux-gnueabihf-raspbian-x64/bin/arm-linux-gnueabihf- -sysroot ~/raspi/sysroot -opensource -confirm-license -make libs -prefix /usr/local/qt5pi -extprefix ~/raspi/qt5pi -hostprefix ~/raspi/qt5 -v -no-use-gold-linker
```
**Terminal output for running QT**
```bash
Qt is now configured for building. Just run 'make'.
Once everything is built, you must run 'make install'.
Qt will be installed into '/home/bjarke/raspi/qt5pi'.
```

Once it finishes look at the **output**. You have to make sure there are no errors. If there are you have to reset the qtbase directory with the following command. 
```bash
git clean -dfx
```
Note: this will still keep the chanes you made to the makespec. 


You will need to put sudo beforehand the terminal outputs commands, because it will be files from your Linux till Raspberry. It is not the Raspberry's files. 

Now we can build Qt. This will build qmake, and all needed libraries as binaries, for the Raspberry Pi.

First we check threads for compiling
```bash
sudo apt install htop
```
```bash
htop
```
I got 8 threads. I i want to utilize the threads so i run the command

```bash
sudo make -j<CPU count>
```
Therefore i run 
```bash
sudo make -j8
```

Now to copy arcoss those libraries to the Pi
```bash
cd ~/raspi
```
```bash
rsync -avz qt5pi pi@$PI_IP:/usr/local
```
Now we need to let the Pi know about these new libraries. So we need to run the following commands. 
### On the Raspberry Pi
```bash
echo /usr/local/qt5pi/lib | sudo tee /etc/ld.so.conf.d/qt5pi.conf
```
```bash
sudo ldconfig
```


## Building and debugging with Qt Creator
Now you are able to build code and copy it across to the Pi with scp, but if you want to develope on the Pi, then you will want to add a kit in Qt to remotely upload compiled code to the Pi, and remotely debug. We have to install the gbd-multiarch to do this. 
### On the Linux
```bash
sudo apt install -y gdb-multiarch
```
### On the Raspberry Pi
```bash
sudo apt install -y gdbserver
```
Now you have to configure the kit and the rest is in the [Heavy Bare Metal](http://heavybaremetal.com/index.php/blog/6-how-to-cross-compile-qt-5-for-raspberry-pi-3)'s guide.


## Change the Server Projekt to be able to cross 
First create a project, there you choice to use both desktop and RPi compiler. Change what compiler you are using. After that edit the .pro file for the default rules for deployment to this. 
```
# Default rules for deployment.
qnx: target.path = /tmp/$${TARGET}/bin
else: unix:!android: target.path = /home/pi/$${TARGET}
!isEmpty(target.path): INSTALLS += target
```

After you build it, then go to the folder where you place the project in the terminal. Then use the command
 ```bash
 cd ..
 ```
 There you will find a folder
 ```bash
  cd build-"projectName"-RPi_3_QT_5_12_3_GCC-Debug
 ```
  ```bash
  cd build-"RPiClient"-RPi_3_QT_5_12_3_GCC-Debug
 ```

 In that folder you will run a secure copy of the exetution filewith the command
   ```bash
scp ./file <Pi Username>"@<Pi IP Adress>:/home/<username>/
 ```
  ```bash
scp ./RPiClient pi@10.77.77.77:/home/pi/
 ```

## Run the Raspberry with Qt
On the we run the Client with going to the folder and the execute the file.
